A player may wish to include cards in their deck that do not match the faction of his identity card. There are many powerful cards in each faction and each faction has things they specialize in, you will frequently want to use most of your influence to bring these powerful tools to your deck. If you arenâ€™t sure what to add, look for broadly applicable cards like icebreakers or ice. For the Corporation, a surprise rez of an out-of-faction ice can be an important turning point in the game!

The number of out-of-faction cards is restricted, however, by the influence limit on the identity card. The combined influence value of out-of-faction
cards in a deck cannot exceed this limit. Each card's influence value is represented by a small blue orbs near the bottom of the card.

Neutral cards are not part of any faction, can be used in any deck of the side they are affiliated with, and generally have an influence value of zero.

> Some cards do not have any influence value (this is different than a card that has an influence value of zero). These cards are identified by their
lack of an influence box. A card without an influence value cannot be used with an identity card that has a different faction affiliation.
