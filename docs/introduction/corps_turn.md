# The Corp’s Turn

During the Corp’s turn, the Corp resolves the following three phases in order: Draw Phase, Action Phase, and Discard Phase.

> The Corp’s deck is called R&D (research and development), the Corp’s hand is called HQ (headquarters), and the Corp’s discard
pile is called Archives. Cards in Android: Netrunner will specifically use these terms when referring to the Corp’s deck, hand, and
discard pile, as appropriate.

## Draw Phase
During the Draw Phase, the Corp draws a card from R&D (their deck) and places it in HQ (their hand). After drawing a card, the Corp proceeds to the Action Phase of this turn.

## Action Phase
During the Action Phase, the Corp has 3 clicks to spend on performing actions and resolving abilities on cards. The Corp can perform the same action or resolve the same ability multiple times during the same turn provided they have enough clicks to spend. The
actions that the Corp can perform during the Action Phase are described in detail in The Corp's Actions. When the Corp has no remaining clicks to spend, they proceed to the Discard Phase of this turn.

## Discard Phase
During the Discard Phase, the Corp must choose and discard cards from HQ down to their maximum hand size. The Corp’s maximum hand size is five unless modified by other effects. When the Corp discards a card from HQ, they place the card facedown in Archives and orient it
sideways. However, if the card was in play faceup when discarded, it is placed faceup into Archives. The facedown cards are oriented sideways so players can see how many facedown cards are in Archives—this information may be useful to the Runner later. After the Corp has discarded down to their maximum hand size, if necessary, the Runner begins their turn.
