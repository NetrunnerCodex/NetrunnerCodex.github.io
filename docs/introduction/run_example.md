Spending his last click, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> (the Runner) initiates a <span class="grey-font-bl">Run</span> against one of <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia’s</span> (the Corp) <span class="grey-font-bl">Remote</span> servers. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has a <span class="red-font-b">Gordian Blade</span>, <span class="red-font-b">Crypsis</span>, and a <span class="red-font-b">Sacrificial Construct</span> installed. He has<span class="red-font-b"> 7</span><span class="nric-red credit"></span>and <span class="grey-font-b">3</span> cards in his <span class="grey-font-bl">Grip</span>. The <span class="grey-font-bl">Remote</span> server has an <span class="grey-font-bl">Unrezzed</span> card in it and <span class="grey-font-b">3</span> pieces of <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> protecting it, one of them <span class="grey-font-bl">Rezzed</span>. The card in the server has <span class="grey-font-b">1</span> <span class="grey-font-bl">Advancement</span> token on it. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> has<span class="blue-font-b"> 10</span><span class="nric-blue credit"></span>.

1. Since the first piece of <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> (<span class="blue-font-b">Enigma</span>) protecting the server is <span class="grey-font-bl">Rezzed</span>, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> must encounter it. <span class="red-font-b">Gordian Blade</span> already has a strength of <span class="grey-font-b">2</span>, and <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> spends<span class="red-font-b"> 1</span><span class="nric-red credit"></span>to break <span class="blue-font-b">Enigma</span>’s second <span class="grey-font-bl">Subroutine</span>, _“End the run”_ and declares he is finished breaking <span class="grey-font-bl">Subroutine</span>. The first <span class="grey-font-bl">Subroutine</span>, _“The Runner loses <span class="nric-grey click"></span>, if able”_ resolves, but <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has no <span class="grey-font-bl">Clicks</span> to lose. Since the <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> was passed, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> approaches the next piece of <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> protecting the server and can either continue the <span class="grey-font-bl">Run</span> or <span class="grey-font-bl">Jack-out</span>. He now has<span class="red-font-b"> 6</span><span class="nric-red credit"></span>in his <span class="grey-font-bl">Credit</span> pool, and decides to continue. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> has the opportunity to <span class="grey-font-bl">Rez</span> cards, but declines to do so. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> then passes that second piece of <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> without encountering it and approaches the innermost piece of <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> protecting the server.

<li>
<span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> once again chooses to continue the <span class="grey-font-bl">Run</span>, feeling confident in his <span class="grey-font-bl">Credits</span> and his <span class="grey-font-bl">Programs</span> in-play. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span>, with<span class="blue-font-b"> 10</span><span class="nric-blue credit"></span>, again has the opportunity to <span class="grey-font-bl">Rez</span> cards. She decides to spend<span class="blue-font-b"> 8</span><span class="nric-blue credit"></span>to <span class="grey-font-bl">Rez</span> <span class="blue-font-b">Wall of Thorns</span>, leaving her with<span class="blue-font-b"> 2</span><span class="nric-blue credit"></span>.
</li>
<li>
<span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> encounters <span class="blue-font-b">Wall of Thorns</span>, spending<span class="red-font-b"> 5</span><span class="nric-red credit"></span>to boost the strength of <span class="red-font-b">Crypsis</span> to <span class="grey-font-b">5</span>.
</li>
<li>
With only<span class="red-font-b"> 1</span><span class="nric-red credit"></span>left, he cannot break both <span class="grey-font-bl">Subroutines</span> on the <span class="blue-font-b">Wall of Thorns</span>. He breaks the <i>“End the run”</i> <span class="grey-font-bl">Subroutine</span> by spending<span class="red-font-b"> 1</span><span class="nric-red credit"></span>, and then must either remove <span class="grey-font-b">1</span> <span class="grey-font-bl">Virus</span> counter from <span class="red-font-b">Crypsis</span> or <span class="grey-font-bl">Trash</span> it.

<ol class="custom-ol" style="--start: 5;">
<li>
Since there are no <span class="grey-font-bl">Virus</span> counters on <span class="red-font-b">Crypsis</span>, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> decides to use <span class="red-font-b">Sacrificial Construct</span> and triggers its prevent effect, <span class="grey-font-bl">Trashing</span> it instead of <span class="red-font-b">Crypsis</span>. The first subroutine on <span class="blue-font-b">Wall of Thorns</span> then triggers and resolves, doing <span class="grey-font-b">2</span> <span class="grey-font-bl">Net Damage</span> (damage is not used in the tutorial, but is described in “Damage”). <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> must <span class="grey-font-bl">Trash</span> <span class="grey-font-b">2</span> random cards from his <span class="grey-font-bl">Grip</span>. He does so, leaving him with a single card. Now, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has passed every piece of <span class="grey-font-bl">Ice</span> protecting the server, he has one last opportunity to <span class="grey-font-bl">Jack-out</span>. He decides to continue the <span class="grey-font-bl">Run</span>. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> can now <span class="grey-font-bl">Rez</span> cards one final time. Since the <span class="grey-font-bl">Unrezzed</span> card in the server is an <span class="grey-font-bl">Agenda</span>, she does not <span class="grey-font-bl">Rez</span> that card.
</li>
<li>The <span class="grey-font-bl">Run</span> is considered successful. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> accesses the <span class="grey-font-bl">Unrezzed</span> card. He flips over the <span class="grey-font-bl">Agenda</span> Nisei-MK-II, steals it, and adds it to his score area. He then takes <span class="grey-font-b">1</span> <span class="grey-font-bl">Net Damage</span> from the Jinteki’s identity card ability. The <span class="grey-font-bl">Run</span> then ends.
</li>
