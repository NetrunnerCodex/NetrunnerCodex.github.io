Spending his last click, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> the Runner initiates a <span class="grey2-font-b">Run</span> against one of <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia’s</span> <span class="grey2-font-b">Remote</span> servers. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has a <span class="red-font-b">Gordian Blade</span>, <span class="red-font-b">Crypsis</span>, and a <span class="red-font-b">Sacrificial Construct</span> installed. He has<span class="red-font-b"> 7</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>and three cards in his <span class="grey2-font-b">Grip</span>. The <span class="grey2-font-b">Remote</span> server has an <span class="grey2-font-b">Unrezzed</span> card in it and three pieces of <span class="grey2-font-b">Ice</span> protecting it, one of them <span class="grey2-font-b">Rezzed</span>. The card in the server has one <span class="grey2-font-b">Advancement</span> token on it. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> has<span class="blue-font-b"> 10</span><span class="nic credit"></span>.

1. Since the first piece of **Ice** protecting the server is **Rezzed**, <span class="red-font-b"><span class="red-font-b">Bart</span></span> must encounter it. Gordian Blade already has a strength of 2, and <span class="red-font-b"><span class="red-font-b">Bart</span></span> spends<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>to break **Enigma**’s second **Subroutine**, _“End the run”_ and declares he is finished breaking **Subroutines**. The first **Subroutine**, _“The Runner loses <span class="nic-red click"></span>, if able”_ resolves, but <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has no **Clicks** to lose. Since the **Ice** was passed, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> approaches the next piece of **Ice** protecting the server and can either continue the **Run** or jack-out. He now has<span class="red-font-b"> 6</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>in his **Credit** pool, and decides to continue. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> has the opportunity to **Rez** cards, but declines to do so. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> then passes that second piece of ice without encountering it and approaches the innermost piece of ice protecting the server.
1. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> once again chooses to continue the run, feeling confident in his credits and his programs in play. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span>, with<span class="blue-font-b"> 10</span><span class="nic credit"></span>, again has the opportunity to **Rez** cards. She decides to spend<span class="blue-font-b"> **8**</span><span class="nic credit"></span>to **Rez** **Wall of Thorns**, leaving her with<span class="blue-font-b"> 2</span><span class="nic credit"></span>.
1. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> encounters **Wall of Thorns**, spending<span class="red-font"> **5**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>to boost the strength of Crypsis to **5**.
1. With only<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>left, he cannot break both **Subroutines** on the **Wall of Thorns**. He breaks the _“End the run”_ **Subroutine** by spending<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>, and then must either remove 1 **Virus** counter from **Crypsis** or **Trash** it. 
1. Since there are no virus counters on **Crypsis**, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> decides to use **Sacrificial Construct** and triggers its prevent effect, **Trashing** it instead of **Crypsis**. The first subroutine on **Wall of Thorns** then triggers and resolves, doing 2 **Net Damage** (damage is not used in the tutorial, but is described in “Damage”). <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> must **Trash** two random cards from his **Grip**. He does so, leaving him with a single card. Now, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has passed every piece of **Ice** protecting the server, he has one last opportunity to jack-out. He decides to continue the **Run**. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> can now **Rez** cards one final time. Since the **Unrezzed** card in the server is an **Agenda**, she does not **Rez** that card.
1. The **Run** is considered successful. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> accesses the **Unrezzed** card. He flips over the **Agenda**, steals it, and adds it to his score area. He then takes 1 **Net Damage** from the Jinteki’s identity card ability. The **Run** then ends.
