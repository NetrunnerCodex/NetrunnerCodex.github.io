Spending his last click, <span class="red-font-b"><span class="red-font-b">Bart</span></span> the Runner initiates a **Run** against one of <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span>’s **Remote** servers. <span class="red-font-b"><span class="red-font-b">Bart</span></span> has a **Gordian Blade**, **Crypsis**, and a **Sacrificial Construct** installed. He has<span class="red-font"> **7**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>and three cards in his **Grip**. The **Remote** server has an **Unrezzed** card in it and three pieces of **Ice** protecting it, one of them **Rezzed**. The card in the server has one **Advancement** token on it. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> has<span class="blue-font-b"> 10</span><span class="nic-blue credit"></span>.

1. Since the first piece of **Ice** protecting the server is **Rezzed**, <span class="red-font-b"><span class="red-font-b">Bart</span></span> must encounter it. Gordian Blade already has a strength of 2, and <span class="red-font-b"><span class="red-font-b">Bart</span></span> spends<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>to break **Enigma**’s second **Subroutine**, “End the run,” and declares he is finished breaking **Subroutines** <span class="blue-font">**(1)**</span>. The first **Subroutine**, “The Runner loses <span class="nic-red click"></span>, if able” resolves, but <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has no clicks to lose.

Since the **Ice** was passed, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> approaches the next piece of **Ice** protecting the server and can either continue the **Run** or jack-out. He now has<span class="red-font-b"> 6</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>in his **Credit** pool, and decides to continue. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> has the opportunity to **Rez** cards, but declines to do so. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> then passes that second piece of ice without encountering it and approaches the innermost piece of ice protecting the server.

2. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> once again chooses to continue the run, feeling confident in his credits and his programs in play. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span>, with<span class="blue-font-b"> 10</span><span class="nic-blue credit"></span>, again has the opportunity to **Rez** cards. She decides to spend<span class="blue-font-b"> **8**</span><span class="nic-blue credit"></span>to **Rez** **Wall of Thorns**, leaving her with<span class="blue-font-b"> 2</span><span class="nic-blue credit"></span><span class="blue-font">**(2)**</span>.

<span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> encounters Wall of Thorns, spending<span class="red-font"> **5**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>to boost the strength of Crypsis to 5 <span class="blue-font">**(3)**</span>. With only<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>left, he cannot break both subroutines on the Wall of Thorns. He breaks the “End the run” subroutine by spending<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span><span class="blue-font">**(4)**</span>, and then must either remove 1 virus counter from Crypsis or trash it. Since there are no virus counters on Crypsis, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> decides to use **Sacrificial Construct** and triggers its prevent effect, trashing it instead of **Crypsis** <span class="blue-font">**(5)**</span>.

The first subroutine on **Wall of Thorns** then triggers and resolves, doing 2 **Net Damage** (damage is not used in the tutorial, but is described in “Damage”). <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> must **Trash** two random cards from his **Grip**. He does so, leaving him with a single card.

Now, <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> has passed every piece of **Ice** protecting the server, he has one last opportunity to jack-out. He decides to continue the **Run**. <span class="blue-font-b">Olivia</span> can now **Rez** cards one final time. Since the **Unrezzed** card in the server is an **Agenda**, she does not **Rez** that card.

The **Run** is considered successful. <span class="red-font-b">Bart</span> accesses the **Unrezzed** card. He flips over the **Agenda**, steals it, and adds it to his score area <span class="blue-font">**(6)**</span>. He then takes 1 **Net Damag**e from the Jinteki’s identity card ability. The **Run** then ends.
