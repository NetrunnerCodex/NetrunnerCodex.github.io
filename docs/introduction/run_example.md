# Run Example

Spending his last click, Bart the Runner initiates a run against one of Olivia’s remote servers. Bart has a **Gordian Blade**, **Crypsis**, and a **Sacrificial Construct** installed. He has<span class="red-font"> **7**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>and three cards in his grip. The remote server has an unrezzed card in it and three pieces of ice protecting it, one of them rezzed. The card in the server has one advancement token on it. Olivia has<span class="red-font"> **10**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>.

Since the first piece of ice protecting the server is rezzed, Bart must encounter it. Gordian Blade already has a strength of 2, and Bart spends<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span> to break **Enigma**’s second subroutine, “End the run,” and declares he is finished breaking subroutines <span class="blue-font">**(1)**</span>. The first subroutine, “The Runner loses <span class="nic-red click"></span>, if able” resolves, but Bart has no clicks to lose.

Since the ice was passed, Bart approaches the next piece of ice protecting the server and can either continue the run or jack out. He now has<span class="red-font"> **6**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>in his credit pool, and decides to continue. Olivia has
the opportunity to rez cards, but declines to do so. Bart then passes that second piece of ice without encountering it and approaches the innermost piece of ice protecting the server.

Bart once again chooses to continue the run, feeling confident in his credits and his programs in play. Olivia, with<span class="red-font"> **10**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>, again has the opportunity to rez cards. She decides to spend<span class="red-font"> **8**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>to rez **Wall of Thorns**, leaving her with<span class="red-font"> **2**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span><span class="blue-font">**(2)**</span>.

Bart encounters Wall of Thorns, spending<span class="red-font"> **5** </span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>to boost the strength of Crypsis to 5 <span class="blue-font">**(3)**</span>. With only<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span>left, he cannot break both subroutines on the Wall of Thorns. He breaks the “End the run” subroutine by spending<span class="red-font"> **1**</span><span class="nic-red credit"></span><span class="blue-font">**(4)**</span>, and then must either remove 1 virus counter from Crypsis or trash it. Since there are no virus counters on Crypsis, Bart decides to use **Sacrificial Construct** and triggers its prevent effect, trashing it instead of **Crypsis** <span class="blue-font">**(5)**</span>.

The first subroutine on **Wall of Thorns** then triggers and resolves, doing 2 net damage (damage is not used in the tutorial, but is described in “Damage”). Bart must trash two random cards from his grip. He does so, leaving him with a single card.

Now, Bart has passed every piece of ice protecting the server, he has one last opportunity to jack out. He decides to continue the run. Olivia can now rez cards one final time. Since the unrezzed card in the server is an agenda, she does not rez that card.

The run is considered successful. Bart accesses the unrezzed card. He flips over the agenda, steals it, and adds it to his score area <span class="blue-font">**(6)**</span>. He then takes 1 net damage from the Jinteki’s identity card ability. The run then ends.
