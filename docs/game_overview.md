> The Netrunner Codex teaches the basic rules of Android: Netrunner. Before starting, players should continue reading the Introduction, Corp and Runner Turn sections, which contain all the rules necessary to begin playing. If questions arise during play, they can find answers to them within the Rules Reference. After finishing their first game, players should read Advanced Concepts.

# Game Overview

Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical game for two players. One player is the Runner, a rogue hacker armed with bleeding-edge gear and software that they use to attack the servers of megacorps. The other player is the head of a powerful Corporation, or Corp, who will relentlessly pursue their goals while attempting to thwart the Runner’s attacks.

During a game of Android: Netrunner, the Runner uses their turns to build a rig of hardware and programs that they can use to steal agendas from the Corp’s servers. The Corp must defend their servers from the Runner’s attacks while trying to advance agendas before the Runner can steal them. The first player to have seven points worth of agendas wins!
